# How to use scaper verkiezingsuitslagen notebook

I quickly scraped the open data of the Belgian elections in May 2019 from the url provided by Open Knowledge Belgium. Follow these steps:

- Follow the steps in the notebook, if something doesn't work, I scraped it on a friday evening, so be patient with me
- Read the manual _EmlMartine_Description_V1_15_NL MediaVersie.docx if you want to extract more information out of the XML files

Althoug it is not done to upload data into a Github repo, I still uploaded the resulting files being candidates_total.csv and partijen_total.csv. These contain all the votes from the election for the "kamer".

Hope this helped
